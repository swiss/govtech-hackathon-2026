## What makes for a (good) Challenge?


We want to work on real problems and ideas. These should be formulated as “Challenges”. Challenges stand at the core of our Hackathons. They are like sparks that ignite projects. Challenges can be of different types and put a range of deliverables in focus:

* an interesting technological challenge
* an organisational challenge, related to social or cultural issues, even those you may not even think at first glance are addressed with technology
* a global challenge that we are dealing with as a society (e.g. linked to Sustainable Development Goals)
* an ongoing project, struggling to deliver or that may benefit from external support, user input and feedback
* an issue or need articulated by users or stakeholders, which needs to be further understood together with others
* …an intriguing idea of some other kind that needs to see the light of day

### Form – Tell a story

Good form is, however, dramatically important to launch effective projects:

* Pains: Why is the challenge… a challenge? What’s the need or problem? For whom? In which situation? 
* Impact: What would it mean i.e. what would be different if the challenge could be addressed, or what will happen if the challenge is not addressed
* Goal: What is your goal for the Hackathon? (expected outcome)
* Small enough: Package small challenges that can be translated into a manageable set of actions. E.g.: «The public sector should improve its API is, probably, too generic.»
* Context: Who are the stakeholders? What are the restrictions?
* History & context: Share a little bit of history about which solutions were already tried.

… and of course, leave room for creativity. Formulate rather open, tricky challenges. Not a clearly defined ‘patch’ that you could actually commission to a programming company. The participants choose their own path around your challenge – trust the process!

Keep in mind that it can always happen that a challenge is not selected to work on: each participant is free to decide on which challenge(s) they want to work on, and they may also change their mind and switch tracks. This does not mean that a challenge is not relevant: every open challenge gets archived and can be proposed again at a later Hackathon.

## What’s an example for a (good) challenge?

The Challenge “[Dashboard electric car charging stations](https://hack.opendata.ch/project/944)” was presented at our GovTech Hackathon in 2023, where this challenge aimed to develop a dashboard to monitor electricity consumption and usage at electric vehicle charging stations in Switzerland. On the respective challenge/project page, you can find more information on the challenge such as the pitch, final presentation or description. Under hack.opendata.ch you can find challenges from past Hackathons.

## What data/resources are needed for a (good) challenge?

We gather data, knowledge and tools to empower people. Accessible, complete and comprehensible data and interfaces are essential for innovation, but even more so at Hackathons. What Data? 

* If you can, open. Open data and open APIs are the most efficient and powerful way to enable collaboration. E.g. handbook.opendata.swiss provides a walkthrough on how to open data.
* To determine whether data can be made open or not is the responsibility of the data owner, who interprets the legal framework related to these data. If the data cannot be made fully open due to legal constraints, you could still make them available for a limited amount of time or for a specific group of users.
* We recommend the frictionless data packaging standard and are thankful for your readiness to help us preparing the relevant sets accordingly. 

In consultation with the event organizing team, well founded exceptions to these rules are possible. Reach out to hackathon-bk[at]bfh.ch if you need any help making your data available at the Hackathon.

## Checklist for a successful challenge

* Accessibility of “own” resources: Are the data, APIs, etc. technically and “legally” (terms of use, NDA, etc.) accessible to the participants (at least) during the Hackathon in order to successfully complete the challenge? Consider accessing websites/services from outside and within (blacklist) the administration. If possible, link the available data sources on your respective project page on our hack platform. 
* Accessibility of third-party resources: Are the data, APIs, etc. of third parties that you need to tackle the challenge accessible within the Hackathon? We recommend that you make the appropriate assessment in advance of the Hackathon and, if necessary, get in touch with the data owners. If possible, link the available data sources on your respective project page on our hack platform. We are happy to provide support (info[at]opendata.ch). 
* Scope: Is the challenge doable in the (short) time? Have I set the right focus: core of the problem, “creative” approaches, prototyping instead of “execution work”?
    Repository and communication: Propose a repository and communication channel for the team (e.g. both on Git(Hub)).
    Challenge Owner Presence: Ideally, the challenge owner (or a proxy) is on-site during the whole Hackathon and accompanies the team (occasional calls or similar are of course no problem). If this is not possible, he/she or the proxy must at least present the Challenge on-site and be available afterward on-site or by phone (give them your number) for questions about the challenge or the resources.
* Sustainability: What happens to the results after the Hackathon? How do we integrate the results of the project into our organization and what constraints are there that the team has to take into account during the Hackathon to enable this? Do we have (financial and human) resources to internally support the project? (How) can we involve the participants beyond the Hackathon? This will also motivate the participants to choose your challenge. 
* Expectation management: It’s possible that your challenge will not be picked by a team. In that specific case, as frustrating as it might be, we still encourage you to stay at the Hackathon and work with (or mentor) other teams, for the insights about innovation and for the networking, but also because oftentimes, if you are actively involved, two rather similar challenges can turn in one project with synergies. And if not, we can tackle it next time!

## How to present a challenge to the participants?

Upload your slides to dribdat and and use the platform as a visual support. For the challenge pitch, we suggest the following structure:

* Title
* Organization
* What is the need or problem? For whom?
* What resources are (not) available (input)?
* What would be different if the problem was solved?
* What is your goal for the Hackathon?
* What are the approaches to solving the problem? Which ones have you already tried?
* What are the limitations? What do you have to pay attention to?
* What happens with the results of the Hackathon?
* Contact details
* Competencies: Which ones are already present in the team? Which ones do you still need or who are you looking for?

## Which platform do we run our Hackathons on?

dribdat (originally from “Driven By Data”) is an open source (MIT licensed) web application, featuring an ideation and challenge board to help organize short sprints, co-creative sessions, hackdays and open Hackathons with batteries included.

Learn how to use dribdat here: https://dribdat.cc/usage.

If you want to host a Hackathon, you can also self-host dribdat. If you need support with setting up, please contact info[at]opendata.ch.
How do you work on our platform? Dribdat 1×1

* Login and join project (Join)
* Document progress, upload data and screenshots (Post)
* Comments (Feedback & Questions about the project)
* Announcements (Important notifications from organisation team)
* Prepare slides/demo for final presentations (Edit & Sync)

## How do you present your project at the end of the Hackathon?

Upload your slides and/or screen recording to dribdat. For your final pitch, we suggest the following structure:

* What was the challenge i.e. the problem you were trying to solve
* How did you attempt to solve it?
* What roadblocks did you encounter?
* What was the result? (Demo)
* What are the next steps?

## What happens to the results of the Hackathon?

The following conditions apply to works created at our Hackathons:

* No transfer of rights | everyone retains the rights to anything he or she has created. It is up to the Hackathon teams to collaborate with challenge owners to continue their work.

* Waiver | No one will exercise any rights of exclusivity with respect to information he brings in, even if he otherwise could exercise such right of exclusivity under the law.

* Open-Source | All participants are required to submit results (Pitch, Prototype code co-developed with the team, Images – not the entire extent of the solution stack) produced under a recognized open source license (opensource.org).

* Courtesy | Give credits. Ask if you can, but by default assume to include all those who have somehow contributed to the project.

* Publication | We require teams to publish the insights and results of the Hackathon openly.

In consultation with the event organizing team, well-founded exceptions to these rules are possible.
